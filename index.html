        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I started learning about web technologies as websites are a perfect way to reach out to a large number of people
          around to let them know about your idea in a very easy way. I love developing websites and I have done a number of 
          projects, making websites and guiding other students in this field. I am a proud web developer at 
          IEEE communications society, VIT vellore chapter.

        <h3>Data Science and  Blockchain technology </h3>
        <p>I started to look into a lot of new technologies, such as AI, blockchain, cybersecurity, and Data Science as 
          these buzzwordz were totally around me all the time in my college. So, I started looking into some of them and found
          the field of data science and bolckchain technnology, not only interesting, but also realized their importance in every sector in 
          present and their constanly increasing value in future as well.
